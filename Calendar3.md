# Calendar3: How It Works

In recent months, projects like QR, Clanker, NOICE, and AMPS have tackled key challenges in the crypto ecosystem. Investors struggle to find high-potential opportunities, while founders face difficulties in choosing the ideal time and platform for their launches. 

QR answers the question, "What's trending today?" 

Calendar3 addresses, "What's the most anticipated launch in the coming days?"

## Overview

Calendar3 is a decentralized platform where each day in a 366-day calendar is an NFT. Founders and projects can reserve a specific date for their event—such as a token launch, fundraiser, or celebration—by paying a rental fee in ETH. Only one event is featured per day, creating a competitive marketplace for visibility and community engagement.

## How It Works

### Booking a Date

- **Process**: Reserve a future date by paying a daily rental fee (base rate: 0.001 ETH per day) and provide event details.
- **Example**: On July 1, 2025, you book August 15, 2025 (45 days away) for a token launch. Pay 0.001 ETH × 45 = 0.045 ETH. Your event is displayed on Calendar3’s August 15, 2025 slot for 45 days.

### Outbidding

- **Mechanism**: Another user can outbid you for the same date by offering at least 10% more per day and renting for at least one additional day.
- **Example**:
  - On July 10, 2025 (10 days later), Vitalik bids for August 15, 2025, offering 0.05 ETH per day for 36 days (35 remaining days + 1 extra) = 1.8 ETH.
  - You receive a refund for the remaining 35 days at the new rate: 0.05 ETH × 35 = 1.75 ETH, yielding a profit of 1.75 ETH - 0.045 ETH = 1.705 ETH for 10 days of visibility.
  - To reclaim the date, you can outbid Vitalik with at least 0.055 ETH per day for 37 days = 2.035 ETH.

### NFT Ownership

- **Structure**: Each calendar day is an NFT. The owner earns 90% of the rental fees; the protocol keeps 10%.
- **Example**: If Varun owns August 15, he earns 90% of 0.045 ETH = 0.0405 ETH for the initial 45 days, and 90% of 0.05 ETH = 0.045 ETH for the 46th day (Vitalik’s bid).
- **Control**: NFT owners can pause rentals to use the date themselves for personal messages or events.

### RSVP System

- **Function**: Users can RSVP to events onchain for a minimum of 0.0001 ETH, paid to the event creator.
- **Metrics**: The number of RSVPs and total ETH paid are displayed, reflecting the event’s popularity.
- **Engagement**: Projects can airdrop rewards to RSVPed users to foster community engagement.

### Importance Metrics

- **Date Value**: Calculated as *Rental price per day × Number of days booked = Total paid*. Higher totals indicate more significant dates.
- **RSVP Data**: The number of RSVPs and total RSVP ETH further highlight community interest.

## Example Scenario: Farcon event on October 1, 2025

- **July 1, 2025**: DEGEN books October 1, 2025 (90 days away) for 0.001 ETH per day = 0.09 ETH. The NFT owner receives 90% = 0.081 ETH.
- **July 10, 2025**: Farcaster outbids with 0.01 ETH per day for 81 days = 0.81 ETH. DEGEN is refunded 0.01 ETH × 80 days = 0.8 ETH, earning a profit of 0.8 ETH - 0.09 ETH = 0.71 ETH. The NFT owner earns 90% of 0.01 ETH for 1 day = 0.009 ETH.
- **July 20, 2025**: Coinbase bids 0.5 ETH per day for 200 days = 100 ETH. Farcaster is refunded 0.5 ETH × 70 days = 35 ETH. The NFT owner earns 90% of 0.5 ETH × 130 days = 58.5 ETH.

## Comparison to QR

- **QR**: Focuses on daily trends ("What's hot today?"). Losing the top spot yields no profit but provides visibility until outbid.
- **Calendar3**: Focuses on future events ("What's hot on upcoming days?"). Outbid renters receive refunds at the new rate, with a profit as well as attention, and NFT owners earn rental income.
